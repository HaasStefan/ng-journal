<h2 align="center">A Community Blog for Angular</h2>


NG Journal is a community blog for Angular with the goal to collect advanced blog posts on Angular written by community members, leaders and experts. 
The mission is to educate and spread opinions on advanced topics. NG Journal should be the place Angular developers go to when they are done with the basics 
and want to explore the ecosystem, patterns, best practices and new ideas.

This is an open source project for the Angular community created by the Angular community. If you have an idea for an advanced opinionated blog post, we would be happy to have you as a writer.

### How to become a writer

This is really simple. Clone this repository, create a new branch and create a markdown file in `/src/content/`. Have a look at the other blog posts in the directory 
and you will see that a blog post is just markdown with some extra front matter.
